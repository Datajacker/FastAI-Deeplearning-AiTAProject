Just kidding, it's a text classification application using FastAI, trained on a database of all reddit "Am I The ***hole" posts. 

This is a deep learning project that trains and deploys a neural net using every "Am I the ***hole" and its verdict from Reddit.

I originally pulled the data set from this article:

https://dvc.org/blog/a-public-reddit-dataset

And used the Fast.ai library, which is a simplified overlay of Pytorch, Pandas, Numpy, SKLearn and other packages.

The Fast.ai quickstart guide can be found here. https://docs.fast.ai/text.html
They also offer a MOOC! And it is awesome.
